Code must follow this conditions: 

Built-in sorting algorithms are not allowed, developers have to implement sorting themselves if needed.

Unless stated otherwise, any algorithm/data structure can be used to solve the exercise, as long as it is implemented by the developer.

You are allowed to use std::unordered_map in C++ and HashMap in Java.

You must implement and use in your submission at least two of the following sorting algorithms: counting sort, radix sort, or bucket sort.
